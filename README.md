### Purpose of the game 
*Get the Treasure game* Move the bluebird avatar (Bob?) to get as many gold coins as possible in under 2 minutes. 

### Instructions 

1. You have two minutes to move the bird around to get randomly located coins. If the bird hits the coin, it is recorded in  the score board.
2. You can move the bird with 4 different keyboard commands
	- **Up**: Make the bluebird fly up
	- **Down**: Make the bluebird fly down
	- **Left**: Make the bluebird fly to the left (the bird can not exit the window size)
	- **Right**:  Make the bluebird fly to the right (the bird can not exit the window size)


### Planning process of the game 

The first step before writing out the code is developing and clearly articulate the purpose of the program through design and prototyping. After being inspired by past works on the [Ruby2d showcase](https://www.ruby2d.com/showcase/), I wanted to create a treasure focused game. I chose a bird avatar so it can fly in collecting coins.

### Aesthetics: 

 - Landing page that runs the game after user clicks a key Bluebird can
   move through sprite animation. Code was developed using
   appropriate clip width
   - Score board for recording how many coins were hit
   - Control speed to match the length of time for each coin appearance

### Future possibilities:  
- Have the bird dodge flying obstacles (other birds)
- Create a landing page where the user has the option to select different bird players and/or different backgrounds 

### Credits 

This game was developed using Ruby2d on Visual Studio Code. Many thanks to the Ruby2d community for support and learning resources.
